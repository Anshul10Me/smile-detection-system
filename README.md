# Smile Detection System 😊

A real-time computer vision project that detects human smiles using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview
This project uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces and smiles in real time through a webcam.
The system is optimized for low latency and improved accuracy by focusing on the lower facial region.

## Key Features
- Real-time face and smile detection
- Optimized frame processing to reduce lag
- Fast camera initialization
- Webcam-based execution

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

## How to Run
pip install opencv-python  
python smile_detection.py

## Controls
- Press `q` or `ESC` to exit
